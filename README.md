PhoneGap

Testing out PhoneGap Build Framework

So basically what this is:
    Not an android tutorial thing, but I promise I have spent a GOOD amount of time working out how to get PhoneGap working. It was mostly trying to get it working on my machine...realizing that it was taking 3 hours and still wasn't working, looking into PhoneGap Build, realizing that PhoneGap Build is MAGIC, setting up a basic HTML page and a link and working on emulating the compiled apk app in the android emulator.
